# Usage: (don't bother changing these, they don't do anything)
# Note: sounds are not explained below. To use a sound, type
#  a value such as AMBIENT_CAVE from the list at
#  https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Sound.html

# In messages, you can use "%player%" to reference the player's name. It will
# get replaced with their name when the message is sent.
example:
  # Specifies whether we will use this section. true = yes, false = no
  enabled: true

  # The default value if nothing else matches. Comment out (using hashes) to
  # not use.
  default: 'This message will display if nothing else matches.'

  # The checking order. Skipping something here will cancel it. Separate by
  #  " then ". Valid options are "ops", "usernames", "permissions". You may use
  #  commas, semicolons or periods (".") to make the grammar better.
  check first: 'ops, then usernames, then permissions'
  # An example with punctuation
  #  check first: usernames. Then, ops; then permissions.

  # The first of the following to match the user will be set as their <event>
  #  message or sound
  when matching:
    ops: 'This message will only display for operators'

    # Check by username. If the username, converted to lower case, matches one
    #  of these, the first one matched will be set as their <event> message or
    #  sound. Note, use spaces instead of periods (".")
    by username:
      my username: 'This message will only be displayed for the user "my.username"'
      another_user: 'This message will only be displayed for the user "another_user"'

    # The first of the following permissions that the user has will be set as
    #  their <event> message or sound. Note, use spaces instead of periods (".")
    by permission:
      awesome person permission: 'This message will be displayed if the person has the permission "awesome.person.permission"'

  otherwise:
    # Exactly the same as above, except that these will display if they do NOT
    # match. Note, "when matching" always takes preference.
